        "the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \n",
        "the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \n",
        "he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \n",

        "when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \n",
        "it makes your blood boil . \n",
        "the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \n",
        "the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \n",
        "freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \n",
        "he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \n",
        "he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \n",

        "andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends . \n",
        "searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \n",

        "to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \n",
        "eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \n",
        "shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \n",

        "unfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \n",
        "in an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \n",
        "he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \n",
        "the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \n",

        "the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \n",
        "glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \n",
        "except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \n",
        "to the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it's just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \n",
        "the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \n",
        "the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \n",

        "each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \n",
        "a couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \n",
        "the regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \n",
        "like any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north's victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \"\"\"\n",

            "the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \n",
            "the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \n",

            "except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \n",
